JENKINS

recap on ci cd

continous deployment you cannot choose 
continouse delivery you can choose if you would deploy or not

what is jenkins
- an open source continous integration tool
- it is written in java
- can execute apche and and apache maven shell scripts window batch commands
- supports common scm tools subversion, git and clearcase
- a server based system running in a servlet continer such as apache tomcat

apche tomcat is a web server handles war files
infastructure set up of jenkins
1. developers check their source code
2. jenkins will pick up the changed source code and trigger a build
3. the build output will be available in the jenkins dash board
   notification can send to automation


poll scm update the very first for example there are two file
 at 1:44 and 1:45 the 1:44 WILL BE UPDATED FIRST


Terminologies
for build trend if sum of build is 10 summary is succesful
clouds even ratio
rain or lightning majority is failed
