continous integration and continous delivery

3 main factors for bridging dev and ops

- configuration management on how we hold of codes/ monitor or review 
our codes

- application lifestle management deployment and building and packing of 
codes for excetable 

- enviroment man developing environment

tooling all 3 main blocks

agile pcd 
continous integ pcdt

continous integ - is a development practice that requires developers to 
integrate code into a shared repository several times

continous deployment - the release of production of software that 
passes the automated test

devops tools
- scm software configuration management and safely storing of saoftwares
  code review and testing configuration on project

- orchestration main tool is jenkins integration of 
  different tools to facilitate devops

-  automated quality assurance the continuum of testing and monitoring

source control management (scm) main tool git
- is a discipline comprising the tools and techniques which is used to manage
change to its software assets
- maintains code history
- compare version and cahnges
- ability to merge changes

orchestration
- builds can be integrated and deployed more frequently
- continous integration workflow
