Docker

what is docker
an open source OS-level virtualization manager




docker components
- docker images
- docker containers
- docker registries

docker best practices

1. containers should be ephemeral
-it can be stopped and destroyed and a new one is build

2. use a .dockerignorefile
-for efficiency during build use to exclude files or directories

3. avoid installing unnecessary packages

4.run olny one process per container

5. minimize the number of layers

6. sort multi line arguments

7. build cache


docker features

- file system isolation
- resource isolation
- network isolation
- copy-on-write
- logging
- change management
- interactive shell



docker
build - compose application without worrying about inconsistencies between
environments and locking into any platform or language
ship - design an application 

why docker

agility - quickly respond to change
control - enables developers to control from infrastructure to apllication
portability - transfer or distribute application from personal computer
to a team to private infrastructure

docker uses cases
CI/CD - enable developers to develop and test applications more quickly 
within any environment


container a basic version of the linux operating system
image software that you load into a container
docker tells your system to use the docker program
run subcommand that will create and run a docker container

how to create docker file

FROM docker/whalesay:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get-install -y fortunes

CMD /usr/games/fortune -a | cowsay
on how to build docker file
do
docker build -t docker-whale .

to run file 
docker run dockerfile





docker file instructions

FROM must be the first instruction in order to specify the base image
	FROM <image>:<tag>
MAINTAINER allows you to set the author field of the image
	MAINTAINER <name>
WORKDIR sets the working directory for any run cmd entry point copy 
and add commands that follow it in the dockerfile
	WORKDIR </path/to/directory>
USER sets the user name or UID to use when running the image and for any RUN CMD and entrypoint
	USE <username>
ARG defines a variable that users can pass during a docker build using the
build-arg<varname>=<value>
	ARG <name>[=<default value>]
ENV sets an environment variable for the image
	ENV<key>=<value>
ADD adds new files directories or remote file URLS into 
the filesystem of the container
	ADD <src><dest>

dest is an absolute path or relative to a workdir



RUB executes a command in a new layer on top of a current image
	RUN<command>

Expose makes the container list on the specified port during runtime
	EXPOSE <port>

ENTRYPOINT allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable
	ENTRYPOINT ["executable","param1","param2"]
	ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2

CMD provides defaults for an executing container
	CMD ["executable","pram1","param2"] (exec form)
	CMD ["param1","param2"] (as params to entrypoint)
CMD command param1 param2
